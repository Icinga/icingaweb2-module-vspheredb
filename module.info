Description: VMware vSphere DB
 This module replicates your most important vCenter configuration items. It
 provides a fast, lightweight (read-only) frontend and highlights potential
 issues. The UI tries to visualize Virtual Machines, Hosts and Datastores
 with lots of related information

 Another purpose of this module is being a Import Source provider for the
 Icinga Director. It has no dependency on any SDK library, had been written
 from scratch for vCenter 6.x and tested with different installations of
 vCenter 6.x and 7.x. Directly accessing ESXi hosts also worked fine.
