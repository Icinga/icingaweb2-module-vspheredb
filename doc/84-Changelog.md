<a id="Changelog"></a>Changelog
===============================

v1.2.1
------

This is a minor bugfix release. A problem with older PHP versions has been fixed.
This affected only End Of Live versions (&lt;7.3), but we still support them.
Depending on your  Curl version, you might have faced problems with vmWare 7.x.
This has also been solved.

To use authentication with InfluxDB v1.x please upgrade the Incubator module to
at least v0.10.1. This is optional, we'll not raise dependencies  with a patch
release. The remaining fixes are mostly there to improve debugging and logging,
and to avoid useless API requests under error conditions.

We usually do not add new features to patch releases, but this release ships a
bunch of new Host Vendor images for HPE, Fujitsu and Dell servers. We're pretty
confident that they'll not cause any problems.

### Upgrading

To benefit from all fixes, please restart the *Background Daemon* after upgrading
the module.

v1.2.0
------

With a background daemon rewritten from scratch, this version improves performance,
speed and stability. It no longer requires a dedicated process per vCenter/ESXi
connection.

There have been many improvements to the UI. And last but not least, you can now
optionally ship  performance data / metrics to InfluxDB instances.

### Breaking Changes
* Installation procedure has been changed

### Upgrading

Please restart the Background Daemon after upgrading to v1.2.0. It then launches
its new Control Socket and applies DB Schema migrations on its own.  The daemon
now needs write permissions for a special directory. Once again, our
[Installation](01-Installation.md) documentation should contain everything you
need.
